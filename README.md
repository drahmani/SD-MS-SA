# State dependent Linear Recurrent Formula
Here we provide Matlab code to implement SD-MS-SA for forecasting time series. We have also provided three set of data sets we used in our paper, IPI time series for France, Germany and the UK, UR for 30 states of Europe 48 states of America. The main file is called SS_A_vs_SD_M_SS_A.m which let you compare MS-SA with SD-MS-SA. You can set up L and r or you can choose a set of values for L and r and let the algorithm choose the one with the lowest RMSE.
